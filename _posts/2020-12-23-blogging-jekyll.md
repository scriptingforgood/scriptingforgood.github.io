While I was doing it mostly with Microsoft toolkit, as my work environment was set to use mostly Microsoft products and support Microsoft clients (That's why I started my exploration with PowerShell and VS Code, you can try differently). 

[Start using Git for PowerShell scripts](https://4bes.nl/2019/06/02/step-by-step-start-using-git-for-powershell/) The path travelled, and support on this way. 
  Prerequisites on Windows: 
  - Ruby (option with Ruby Installer or with WSL), Ruby gems
  - Git, GitHub account, 
  - VS code and PowerShell. 

### somehow, I couldn't access ruby, bundler and jekyll (checking their version in VS Code), thus, I couldn't work with already existing github pages. 
I didn't understand the difference between WSL way and Ruby-installer way. Decided to go with Ruby-installer on  both machines I had. Because.. My own energy and memory resources.. Perhaps, for it to work better, one way only is good. One non-dual way. Then I could describe it, iterate it. Kind of the path travelled.
