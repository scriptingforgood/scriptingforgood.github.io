I was exploring Jekill blogging initially with Microsoft toolkit, as my work environment was set to use mostly Microsoft products and support Microsoft clients. That's why I started my exploration with PowerShell and VS Code. 

### Some of the guides and sources that I have explored include: 
- [holistic security](https://holisticsecurity.io/2020/03/30/github-pages-and-jekyll-on-windows-10)
- [Start using Git for PowerShell scripts](https://4bes.nl/2019/06/02/step-by-step-start-using-git-for-powershell/) The path travelled, and support on this way. 
  Prerequisites on Windows: 
  - Ruby (option with Ruby Installer or with WSL), Ruby gems
  - Git, GitHub account, 
  - VS code and PowerShell. 

### somehow, I couldn't access ruby, bundler and jekyll (checking their version in VS Code), thus, I couldn't work with already existing github pages. 
I didn't understand the difference between WSL way and Ruby-installer way. Decided to go with Ruby-installer on  both machines I had. Because.. My own energy and memory resources.. Perhaps, for it to work better, one way only is good. One non-dual way. Then I could describe it, iterate it. Kind of the path travelled. 

### To conclude, tools used: 
Git (version control) and GitHub (Git provider), PowerShell (Microsoft scripting language), VS Code (IDE, helpful in writing and editing code). 
Adding to this mix Jekyll (Static Site generator written in Ruby programming language) with Minimal Mistakes theme (Jekyll theme).
