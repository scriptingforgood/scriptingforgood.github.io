I was exploring Jekill blogging initially with Microsoft toolkit, as my work environment was set to use mostly Microsoft products and support Microsoft clients. That's why I started my exploration with PowerShell and VS Code. 

### The guide that I have explored initially: 
- [Start using Git for PowerShell scripts](https://4bes.nl/2019/06/02/step-by-step-start-using-git-for-powershell/) The path travelled, and support on this way. 
  - Ruby (option with Ruby Installer or with WSL on Windows), Ruby gems
  - Git (version control), 
  - GitHub account (Git provider), 
  - PowerShell (Microsoft scripting language),
  - Jekyll (Static Site generator written in Ruby programming language with Minimal Mistakes theme).
