Often times there is a huge desire to go several paths at once for me. 
Yet at once I live one life. 
Unless.. Books? TV shows? They do integrate in my life neatly. 
However, the times I try to get something while mixing all kinds of methods and checking about the direction with so many sources. 
Memory (Si in MBTI) likes when you come back to the same thing just under different circumstances (Ne in MBTI). 
Thus the path is one. And it's tested under all conditions.
