## (Inner Peace)[https://blog.tree.cards/poems-about-peace/]
Inner peace; wish to attain, 
Peace of mind, one shall gain. 
Spiritually and Mentally, 
Won't be achieved accidentally. 

Conscious enlightenment, ultimate goal, 
Living life to the fullest; being whole. 
Knowledge shall help one understand, 
That inner peace is truly grand. 

The beauty of it, is the lack of stress, 
Bliss and happiness, shall possess. 
One must know, oneself quite well, 
To attain a healthy, internal shell.
