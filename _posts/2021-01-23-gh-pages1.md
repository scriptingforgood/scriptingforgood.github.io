### Got an error while trying to run my website locally with "bundle exec jekyll serve": 
```ruby
bundle exec jekyll serve
Could not find gem 'github-pages x64-mingw32' in any of the gem sources listed in your Gemfile.
```
added   
`gem "github-pages", "~> 209", group: :jekyll_plugins` 
and runned `bundle install` 
Could probably just type `bundle install`, it would do just fine.
