Rules by which you consciously or unconsciously make decisions. What are they? 

Well, I personally have plenty of things that I tried on myself. Yeah, my 20s I've tried to find some guidance in my life. Thus many things that I've tried, my 30+ year self would not feel right about, or at the very least doubt. 

Here we go, the things that I don't want to be in priority when I make serious decisions: 
- moon calendar, 
- Western astrology, 
- Chinese astrology (like, the Rat year - 2020 - everyone distances from each other). However.. What if you are in China and Chinese people that believe in it are around? That what I mean by not keeping it in a high priority, leaving it as is. We are influenced by cultures we leave in. 

What could be in priority?
- can make you into someone you aspire to be, develop certain characteristics, skills? 
- encourages a dialogue? 
- asking advice from people you trust in this matters. 
- what's your compassionate line? (from Thich Nhat Nanh)
- people around that want you to be the best version of you, to be happy, to succeed.

Current strongest vices: 
- overcontrol and mistrust. Have to put Faith in beings around and in myself, be more transparent.
